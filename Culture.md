# Religion

The *Kumasčefkẽ* believe that the Sun is the most important god and that he told their prophet, *Heos ã Čefke* ("Heos of the Sun") to go east because that's where their promised land is. Later on and in the modern day, this is instead interpreted metaphorically, meaning to isolate relatively and live modestly. 

There are lesser gods/spirits/angels such as *Lỹca* and *Šuse* who are the spirits of the moons who delivered the Sun's message to go eat to Heos.

# Calendar

The Kumasčefkẽ use a solar calendar that's counted from when Heos had his revelation around the beginning of T41. *AH* is *After Heos* and *BH* is *Before Heos*

# Political Organization

The Kumasčefkẽ are divided into 12 tribes, the head (called the *Luna*) of each is a position generally inherited from parent to eldest child, the original 12 leaders were chosen by Heos himself, making this position religious as well as political. The 12 leaders meet every year (*Tewe ã Lunu*) to discuss matters that affect all of the tribes and choose a leader among themselves to lead all of them. 

While the Luna is generally an inherited position, 4 of the tribes pick theirs democratically, with every adult getting a vote. 

There was general discontent among the Luna about the isolation of the Kumasčefkẽ 800 AH, especially among the tribes bordering Szo and Spath's culture. This caused the council to ease on the isolation and they have now began to strengthen and grow their cities.
